This bundle contains data that can be used to try CampaignChain or to demo it
to potential users. Learn how to use it at http://doc.campaignchain.com/en/master/developer/book/sample_data.html.

The sample data leverages the Amariki development environment, i.e. the various
Amariki test accounts and instances we set up at Twitter, Facebook, MailChimp,
wordpress.amariki.com and other online channels. Learn more about the
development environment at http://doc.campaignchain.com/en/master/developer/book/development_environment.html.
